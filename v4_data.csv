In most countries, this is pretty easy to pinpoint, for instance Japan values collectivism, conformity, and harmony. The US, however, is notoriously difficult to pinpoint a political culture; the reason is that countries like Japan tend not to have much immigration, but also we have freedom of opinion and heavily value individualism. When our political opinion is formed by family, school, religion, race, social class, and gender, having a very diverse free-speaking population in the US it can make sense why we would have a large amount of variety in political values as well.","The proposed law would affect fiscal policy through how much they would then have to spend on entitlement programs further cutting into discressionary spending. Entitlement spending is what the government is required by law to pay for instance medicare and social security. Whereas discressionary is what the government choses to spend money on like natioal defense and wellfare programs. Finally, the amount paid on the national debt interest rate each year is also apart of the budget. All three of these comprise fiscal policy given that fiscal policy is the spending of the the peoples taxes by the governement in a fiscal year which runs from October 1st to September 30th. This policy is decided every year by Congress and if they do not come up with a plan in time then the Governement shuts down. ","I only really used it for grammer,",,,,

It should be common sense to say that speaking languages beyond English makes a person better prepared to communicate with others, but there is a growing opinion that the benefits of being multilingual have become obsolete. A piece from the Daily Mail voices this opinion when its author describes ""go[ing] [...] to one of the [...] international junkets in which film studios hold to promote their latest blockbusters,"" and encountering ""a single extraordinary language that [...] Brazilian, Swedish, Japanese, and Italian reporters use both to chat with one another and question [...] American stars."" The unsaid implication, that English is the only language necessary for international success, grossly oversimplifies the prevalence of English on multiple levels. The film industry has a major hub in the English-speaking USA because of Hollywood, sure, but that's not an adequate reason to wave away the benefits of proficiency in other languages one might encounter in the field. The colonial-adjacent mindset that English is the only language of value due to its universality (a universality that is in and of itself the direct result of colonization) erases the diverse non-English markets in entertainment and beyond.",,1,A little,,

While Erika Kirk forgave the assassin, President Trump took a more radical position, saying that he ""hate[s] his [political] opponents,"" while referring to Charlie's murderer. Despite both grieving over the loss of a husband and close friend, they had wildly differing opinions of the appropriate reaction. Erika focused on the Christian, God-fearing side of Charlie, emphasizing forgiveness, while President Trump framed his reaction in the sense of a political disagreement. Their differing reactions were shaped by what each believed Charlie would have wanted in the same position. This contrast shows that society often divides itself along political and moral lines, acting from either personal ideology or a sense of shared humanity.","	The history of, and culture around the penny is priceless to the people of the United States. It acts as a fragment of history small enough to carry around in a pocket or in the palm of one’s hand. According to a press release, the penny acts as an “image emblematic of the President Lincoln’s preservation of the United States of America.” The penny’s feature of a picture of President Lincoln on one side, and symbols relating to his presidency on the other, give a penny value beyond just one cent. President Lincoln played a crucial role in the founding of America by uniting the fighting sides after the Civil War, and that story is told on every penny across the country. Along with history, current culture relating to the penny is evident, especially in Tennessee where the zinc used in the penny is primarily mined in the rich Tennessee mines. According to Lewis, two lawmakers of the state introduced a resolution ""commemorating the 20th anniversary of the zinc-based penny.” The lawmakers decision and public’s support in Tennessee of the penny illuminates the current cultural importance of the coin. Even with its near-zero financial value, the one-cent coin provides cultural value like no other. The backing of the penny’s history and culture fortifies its place in the US economy.

Daylight saving time requires an overnight adjustment by almost every American and demands the average civilian to go through the lengthy process of resetting their sleep and waking schedules. In fact, studies have shown that “the body’s internal clock [...] does not adjust,” and that, even during daylight saving time, people “tended to sleep on standard time.” (O-Connor) DST forces people to sleep and wake at times unnaturally early for their bodies, disrupting the brain’s ability to recover overnight. Unrestful sleep can impact many aspects necessary for day-to-day living, such as focus, tolerance to fatigue, and perceptiveness. Another overlooked consequence of this sudden shift in hours is the increase in traffic risks. Pedestrian fatalities from crashes are much more likely in the weeks following the end of DST (graph), presumably because drivers, accustomed to driving in broad daylight, must adapt to a darkened sky and dimmer roads. Because of daylight saving time, pedestrians’ well-being are put in much greater danger; in comparison, if standard time was kept year-round, drivers would be allowed to gradually familiarize themselves to darker conditions as the sunlit hours decreased incrementally. Because daylight saving time negatively impacts the health of many Americans, it should be removed from society.

Through my engineering coursework and experience working around aircraft, I have developed strong skills in following detailed procedures, using tools accurately, and staying disciplined about safety protocols. These experiences have shown me how important reliable avionics systems are to aircraft performance. I am excited about this position because it would allow me to apply these skills directly to building, maintaining, and troubleshooting advanced flight systems.
        Air Aviation LLC’s work in electric aviation and next-generation air mobility strongly aligns with my long-term goals in the aerospace field. I admire the company’s commitment to innovation and sustainable flight, and I am motivated by the opportunity to contribute to groundbreaking aircraft technology. The hands-on responsibilities described—such as supporting flight test operations, maintaining fly-by-wire systems, and helping develop maintenance procedures. I bring strong communication skills, a collaborative mindset, and reliability in following safety and documentation standards. I am confident that my skills and intrentes in aviation, along with my ability to learn quickly would allow me to add value to the Flight Test Maintenance team","A larger community can invoke changes in lives that can benefit countries and large cities. During the French Revolution, the poor working class, low wages, and heavy taxes left the third estate (which held the largest population in France) living in poverty, barely affording food on the table. Where the first and second party lived life to the fullest. Each party was given one vote, and due to the first and second party having two votes over the third party was the primarily taxed party. This led to the third party protesting and starting a Revolution to overthrow France’s monarchy. When a large group of people is oppressed, they stand together to make life fairer. These large knit communities can make great changes due to the community's strength and morals. Which reinforces that the community voice can speak louder and the truth behind their actions for the greater good.
Even with big communities with good morals in mind, there can be unforeseen consequences that can be worse than the original problem. During the time of prohibition in the USA, all alcoholic beverages were banned, which, to that point in time, had been a staple of economics and everyday life. While a larger community of women banded together to stop alcohol, it only led to problems after the law was passed. Moonshine became more popular, and many mistakenly died from the poorly made home alcohol. Due to alcohol being so essential in the USA, gangs and people like Alcoapon gained power in larger cities like Chicago. Crime and corruption in the government skyrocketed with cops accepting bribes of alcohol, and many people going to illegal bars to drink. This illustrates why, even with good intentions, groups of people can still harm the community. The community stresses the importance of truth and goodness, but causes problems later on that tends to be more harmful to the community in the long run.
With tight knit committees, the minority of people can be left with an unfavorable basis and stereotypes due to the committee's ideologies of truth. In the book To Kill a Mockingbird, it clearly conveys a powerful community that has a negative message. When a black man is put on trial for a crime he physically could not commit, the community turns on him due to the fact of the color of his skin. The committee draws a parallel to the real-world injustices faced with committees not giving the truth or the best outcome. Though there might be signal voices that give truth, the larger group of people has the power to shut down the truth.

Low-income shoppers have fewer options and have to shop at discount stores, which, according to Green America, were slower to adopt non-toxic or digital receipts.
Even if small businesses could afford upgraded POS systems, they may not be prepared for the legal, security, and compliance responsibilities that come with handling digital customer information. Mandating digital receipt capability could unintentionally create liability risks, increase regulatory burdens, and expose both consumers and businesses to data breaches.

Some nonbinary people struggle with feeling unseen or invalidated when others assume everyone fits into only “male” or “female.” It can also be hard when forms, bathrooms, or school rules don’t include options that match their identity. Misgendering—when someone uses the wrong name or pronouns—can feel frustrating or exhausting over time. Many nonbinary people also face pressure to “explain themselves” even when they shouldn’t have to. Despite these challenges, a lot of nonbinary individuals show incredible resilience, building supportive communities and expressing their identity in ways that feel authentic.","67 is popular meme on the internet.

One of the most significant groups of partisans was the “Bielski Brigade”, a group of Jewish Poles who fled into the forests of Poland to offer heavy resistance, with over 1,200 members in 1944. They were one of the few resistance organizations that accepted the membership of Jews, so a lot of Jewish partisans had to hide their identities in Poland. One incredible story from the brigade is that of Mira Shebub, who (with her unit) attacked Nazi police stations and trains, severely damaging the Nazi lines of logistics (JPEF). There were other countries home to large groups of resistance, for example Lithuania’s Abba Kovner created a resistance network - United Partisan Organization - and “earned a distinguished record, destroying over 180 miles of train tracks, 5 bridges, 40 enemy train cars, killing 212 enemy soldiers, and rescuing at least 71 Jews,” alongside attempting to mass poison a group of Nazi POWs after the war and helping create the state of Israel. Another great example of a WW2 partisan is that of Italian partisan Eugenio Gentili-Tedeschi, who, alongside his group of Partisans, would hold the tight Alpine trails that fed the Nazi war machine during the fight for Italy. He personally stored the dynamite they used to destroy bridges underneath his own bed, before fighting directly alongside American and British troops on the frontline when it reached them.",,3,Some,,

They may compete with native species or overconsume local resources, making their introduction potentially devastating (SC Wildlife, 2025). However, snails are not always detrimental. A study by researchers at Suzhou University found that terrestrial mollusks, including snails and slugs, can contribute to litter decomposition; as snail populations increase, their waste provides material for microbes to decompose, which can also accelerate the decomposition rates of surrounding aquatic plants (Hong Yongxiang et al., 2019). Similarly, Mathew (2024) notes that “Snails and slugs play important roles in the decomposition of organic matter.

It’s why we like the look of a nice flower bouquet or the fancy patterns on a chandelier, and it’s why we like the music we like. The trouble is finding the right balance— if something is too complex, we can’t find any pleasant patterns without considerable effort, and the thing is meaningless to us. If something is too simple, then the thing is too predictable and doesn’t stimulate us, so it also means nothing (Hudson). Pop music just does its best to scratch the itch for music just barely complex enough for us to enjoy.

The Supreme Court dismissed this case because Texas has no standing; each state has the 10th amendment reserve power over how they carry out elections. Texas is only in charge of their own state, they have no authority over how Pennsylvania, Georgia, Michigan, or Wisconsin conduct their elections. Additionally, they cannot prove injury or near-sustaining injury, which is judicial standing - meaning their case is inadmissible.

Even though spheres were formed in the same CaCl₂ solution, small differences in volume or yeast distribution could have affected the rate of reaction by changing the amount of catalase present. Another limitation is that the yeast spheres may not have spent enough time in the temperature baths to fully adjust to the set conditions. If the enzymes inside the spheres had more time to “soak in” the temperature, the reaction rates might have been more consistent and reflective of the true enzyme activity at each condition. To improve the design, a standardized droplet tool, such as a micropipette, could be used to ensure all spheres are identical in size, and the equilibration time in the water baths could be extended to ensure the spheres reach the intended temperature. While the overall pattern was clear, the variability makes the data less exact. ","	UCLA has been ranked as the #1 public university in the nation by U.S. News and World Report for 8 years in a row (“Rankings | UCLA”), and accurately so. These rankings are mainly based on their students' graduation rates, first-year retention rates, and economic outcomes (“Rankings | UCLA”). The four-year graduation rate for the Class of 2024 was the highest it had ever been, with 87.3% of the students who enrolled in the fall of 2020 graduating. The graduation rate just keeps going up every year (“Graduation & Time to Degree | UCLA Academic Planning and Budget”), and that’s a sign of a good university, as they are retaining and graduating the vast majority of students on time. When choosing a college, one of the main things you need to consider is whether you will graduate in four, five, six, or even more years. It is reassuring to know that UCLA’s four-year graduation rate is high, because it’s expensive to go to college for more years. Additionally, UCLA graduates’ initial salaries are higher than average at $49,600 one year after graduation, and it is more or less depending on the major (“CollegeSimply”), while the national average salary one year after graduating with a bachelor’s degree is $44,595 (“Innovators Choose Wonder”). This shows that UCLA is proficient in setting up its students for financial success in their futures.","I used AI for the paragraph above to brainstorm an idea for the reflection of my lab.

Scott Fitzgerald uses language choices like imagery and word choice to illustrate the illusion of false identity that Gatsby clings to, and to characterize him as being materialistic and vain. During the tour, Gatsby shows off all of his extravagant rooms and possessions. When they get to his closet, he shows them that he owns “shirts with stripes and scrolls and plaids in coral and apple-green and lavender and faint orange, and monograms of Indian blue” by “throwing them” onto a table. This incredibly long and detailed description of all of the different shirts Gatsby owns helps the reader visualize each shirt, emphasizing the sheer amount of clothing Gatsby is displaying. The lavishness and excessiveness of owning so many shirts in so many different styles characterizes Gatsby as materialistic. This huge amount of fancy shirts are yet another status symbol Gatsby shows off to Daisy and Nick, showing how important it is to Gatsby to be perceived as incredibly wealthy. This is a part of a larger illusion that Gatsby holds: he has an image of an idealized, fairy tale life, of being someone who was born into money and fitting in with high society, which drives him to try to impress his immense wealth onto everyone he meets. So, language choices like imagery and word choice during the scene where Gatsby shows Daisy his shirts illustrate the illusions Gatsby holds and characterize him as materialistic.",,1,A little,,

I focused on one species that spreads quickly and competes with native plants for sunlight and soil nutrients. Through field observations and notes from our class readings, I found that the decline of native plants leads to fewer habitats for insects and small animals. This chain reaction shows how even a single invasive species can reshape an entire ecosystem. Completing this assignment helped me understand how interconnected environmental systems really are.

I used AI to answer this question.

","For the AI-assisted paragraph above, I used AI for the entire drafting process: brainstorming the topic, generating the sentences, and organizing them into a coherent short paragraph. I also refined the wording and structure during generation to make it clear and consistent.",2,Some,,

In the early years abolitionists and feminists met at the Seneca Falls convention to repute grievances and leading up to this period used more forceful means. The importance of social movements for social change from 1945-1980 was huge in prompting change, but also major in polarization. Riots prompted change but sometimes at the expense of human life like at Kent state.","After the first WW1, the US was hit with a huge post war depression. This continued until the start of WW2 which expanded the economy with huge war industry growth. That success transferred into the post war economy. The United States society responded to economic changes in disparities and veteran returns through the GI bill and huge spending in social welfare.

As members of congress, we have the responsibility to make the most with our time.
","Reducing our government to one person in leadership would have disatereous effects. It would literally create an authoritarian state. This bill would give the power back to the reprepresentitives, allowing for more granular and fair representation.
By passing this amendment we would usher in a new era defined by the aforementioned thesis of the holy grail; we have the right to have a say in how we are ruled. We have a right to reject unjust leadership and to grab our government by its horns and right it as the people deem fit.

One advantage is quality is ensured with specialization/homogenous products. These products are easy to produce since there isn’t customization (other than the painting) to be done, thus there is a high output in a smaller time frame. Automated parts allow for these benefits, ensuring consistency with manufacturing. Tesla can therefore benefit from a productive, likely low defect (due to automated processes) method to mass producing cars. On the other end, there are some disadvantages to using high automation in Tesla production. ","In other words, a homeowner isn’t going to let their lawn grow out past 5 inches just because that might improve some habitat loss. Urban areas are dense in terms of population and infrastructure, thus combatting concerns of noise pollution, air pollution, water contamination, and habitat loss may not be easily achievable without support from communities. Therefore, we can’t guarantee that rewilding is worth the effort, whether it be in damaged land, rural land, or urban land. ",,3,A little,,
