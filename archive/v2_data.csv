In most countries, this is pretty easy to pinpoint, for instance Japan values collectivism, conformity, and harmony. The US, however, is notoriously difficult to pinpoint a political culture; the reason is that countries like Japan tend not to have much immigration, but also we have freedom of opinion and heavily value individualism. When our political opinion is formed by family, school, religion, race, social class, and gender, having a very diverse free-speaking population in the US it can make sense why we would have a large amount of variety in political values as well.","The proposed law would affect fiscal policy through how much they would then have to spend on entitlement programs further cutting into discressionary spending. Entitlement spending is what the government is required by law to pay for instance medicare and social security. Whereas discressionary is what the government choses to spend money on like natioal defense and wellfare programs. Finally, the amount paid on the national debt interest rate each year is also apart of the budget. All three of these comprise fiscal policy given that fiscal policy is the spending of the the peoples taxes by the governement in a fiscal year which runs from October 1st to September 30th. This policy is decided every year by Congress and if they do not come up with a plan in time then the Governement shuts down. ","I only really used it for grammer,",,,,

It should be common sense to say that speaking languages beyond English makes a person better prepared to communicate with others, but there is a growing opinion that the benefits of being multilingual have become obsolete. A piece from the Daily Mail voices this opinion when its author describes ""go[ing] [...] to one of the [...] international junkets in which film studios hold to promote their latest blockbusters,"" and encountering ""a single extraordinary language that [...] Brazilian, Swedish, Japanese, and Italian reporters use both to chat with one another and question [...] American stars."" The unsaid implication, that English is the only language necessary for international success, grossly oversimplifies the prevalence of English on multiple levels. The film industry has a major hub in the English-speaking USA because of Hollywood, sure, but that's not an adequate reason to wave away the benefits of proficiency in other languages one might encounter in the field. The colonial-adjacent mindset that English is the only language of value due to its universality (a universality that is in and of itself the direct result of colonization) erases the diverse non-English markets in entertainment and beyond.",,1,A little,,

While Erika Kirk forgave the assassin, President Trump took a more radical position, saying that he ""hate[s] his [political] opponents,"" while referring to Charlie's murderer. Despite both grieving over the loss of a husband and close friend, they had wildly differing opinions of the appropriate reaction. Erika focused on the Christian, God-fearing side of Charlie, emphasizing forgiveness, while President Trump framed his reaction in the sense of a political disagreement. Their differing reactions were shaped by what each believed Charlie would have wanted in the same position. This contrast shows that society often divides itself along political and moral lines, acting from either personal ideology or a sense of shared humanity.","	The history of, and culture around the penny is priceless to the people of the United States. It acts as a fragment of history small enough to carry around in a pocket or in the palm of one’s hand. According to a press release, the penny acts as an “image emblematic of the President Lincoln’s preservation of the United States of America.” The penny’s feature of a picture of President Lincoln on one side, and symbols relating to his presidency on the other, give a penny value beyond just one cent. President Lincoln played a crucial role in the founding of America by uniting the fighting sides after the Civil War, and that story is told on every penny across the country. Along with history, current culture relating to the penny is evident, especially in Tennessee where the zinc used in the penny is primarily mined in the rich Tennessee mines. According to Lewis, two lawmakers of the state introduced a resolution ""commemorating the 20th anniversary of the zinc-based penny.” The lawmakers decision and public’s support in Tennessee of the penny illuminates the current cultural importance of the coin. Even with its near-zero financial value, the one-cent coin provides cultural value like no other. The backing of the penny’s history and culture fortifies its place in the US economy.

Daylight saving time requires an overnight adjustment by almost every American and demands the average civilian to go through the lengthy process of resetting their sleep and waking schedules. In fact, studies have shown that “the body’s internal clock [...] does not adjust,” and that, even during daylight saving time, people “tended to sleep on standard time.” (O-Connor) DST forces people to sleep and wake at times unnaturally early for their bodies, disrupting the brain’s ability to recover overnight. Unrestful sleep can impact many aspects necessary for day-to-day living, such as focus, tolerance to fatigue, and perceptiveness. Another overlooked consequence of this sudden shift in hours is the increase in traffic risks. Pedestrian fatalities from crashes are much more likely in the weeks following the end of DST (graph), presumably because drivers, accustomed to driving in broad daylight, must adapt to a darkened sky and dimmer roads. Because of daylight saving time, pedestrians’ well-being are put in much greater danger; in comparison, if standard time was kept year-round, drivers would be allowed to gradually familiarize themselves to darker conditions as the sunlit hours decreased incrementally. Because daylight saving time negatively impacts the health of many Americans, it should be removed from society.

Through my engineering coursework and experience working around aircraft, I have developed strong skills in following detailed procedures, using tools accurately, and staying disciplined about safety protocols. These experiences have shown me how important reliable avionics systems are to aircraft performance. I am excited about this position because it would allow me to apply these skills directly to building, maintaining, and troubleshooting advanced flight systems.
        Air Aviation LLC’s work in electric aviation and next-generation air mobility strongly aligns with my long-term goals in the aerospace field. I admire the company’s commitment to innovation and sustainable flight, and I am motivated by the opportunity to contribute to groundbreaking aircraft technology. The hands-on responsibilities described—such as supporting flight test operations, maintaining fly-by-wire systems, and helping develop maintenance procedures. I bring strong communication skills, a collaborative mindset, and reliability in following safety and documentation standards. I am confident that my skills and intrentes in aviation, along with my ability to learn quickly would allow me to add value to the Flight Test Maintenance team","A larger community can invoke changes in lives that can benefit countries and large cities. During the French Revolution, the poor working class, low wages, and heavy taxes left the third estate (which held the largest population in France) living in poverty, barely affording food on the table. Where the first and second party lived life to the fullest. Each party was given one vote, and due to the first and second party having two votes over the third party was the primarily taxed party. This led to the third party protesting and starting a Revolution to overthrow France’s monarchy. When a large group of people is oppressed, they stand together to make life fairer. These large knit communities can make great changes due to the community's strength and morals. Which reinforces that the community voice can speak louder and the truth behind their actions for the greater good.
Even with big communities with good morals in mind, there can be unforeseen consequences that can be worse than the original problem. During the time of prohibition in the USA, all alcoholic beverages were banned, which, to that point in time, had been a staple of economics and everyday life. While a larger community of women banded together to stop alcohol, it only led to problems after the law was passed. Moonshine became more popular, and many mistakenly died from the poorly made home alcohol. Due to alcohol being so essential in the USA, gangs and people like Alcoapon gained power in larger cities like Chicago. Crime and corruption in the government skyrocketed with cops accepting bribes of alcohol, and many people going to illegal bars to drink. This illustrates why, even with good intentions, groups of people can still harm the community. The community stresses the importance of truth and goodness, but causes problems later on that tends to be more harmful to the community in the long run.
With tight knit committees, the minority of people can be left with an unfavorable basis and stereotypes due to the committee's ideologies of truth. In the book To Kill a Mockingbird, it clearly conveys a powerful community that has a negative message. When a black man is put on trial for a crime he physically could not commit, the community turns on him due to the fact of the color of his skin. The committee draws a parallel to the real-world injustices faced with committees not giving the truth or the best outcome. Though there might be signal voices that give truth, the larger group of people has the power to shut down the truth.

Low-income shoppers have fewer options and have to shop at discount stores, which, according to Green America, were slower to adopt non-toxic or digital receipts.
Even if small businesses could afford upgraded POS systems, they may not be prepared for the legal, security, and compliance responsibilities that come with handling digital customer information. Mandating digital receipt capability could unintentionally create liability risks, increase regulatory burdens, and expose both consumers and businesses to data breaches.

Some nonbinary people struggle with feeling unseen or invalidated when others assume everyone fits into only “male” or “female.” It can also be hard when forms, bathrooms, or school rules don’t include options that match their identity. Misgendering—when someone uses the wrong name or pronouns—can feel frustrating or exhausting over time. Many nonbinary people also face pressure to “explain themselves” even when they shouldn’t have to. Despite these challenges, a lot of nonbinary individuals show incredible resilience, building supportive communities and expressing their identity in ways that feel authentic.","67 is popular meme on the internet.

One of the most significant groups of partisans was the “Bielski Brigade”, a group of Jewish Poles who fled into the forests of Poland to offer heavy resistance, with over 1,200 members in 1944. They were one of the few resistance organizations that accepted the membership of Jews, so a lot of Jewish partisans had to hide their identities in Poland. One incredible story from the brigade is that of Mira Shebub, who (with her unit) attacked Nazi police stations and trains, severely damaging the Nazi lines of logistics (JPEF). There were other countries home to large groups of resistance, for example Lithuania’s Abba Kovner created a resistance network - United Partisan Organization - and “earned a distinguished record, destroying over 180 miles of train tracks, 5 bridges, 40 enemy train cars, killing 212 enemy soldiers, and rescuing at least 71 Jews,” alongside attempting to mass poison a group of Nazi POWs after the war and helping create the state of Israel. Another great example of a WW2 partisan is that of Italian partisan Eugenio Gentili-Tedeschi, who, alongside his group of Partisans, would hold the tight Alpine trails that fed the Nazi war machine during the fight for Italy. He personally stored the dynamite they used to destroy bridges underneath his own bed, before fighting directly alongside American and British troops on the frontline when it reached them.",,3,Some,,

Curious, he opened it and discovered that the pages were filled with handwritten stories from someone who had lived in his house over a hundred years ago. As he read, he realized the writer had the same dreams he did—traveling, learning, and exploring the world. The book made Jordan feel connected to the past, and he decided to continue the tradition by writing his own stories at the end, hoping someone in the future would discover them too.","Jordan found an old book in his attic while he was cleaning.
